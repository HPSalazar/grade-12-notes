Ice turns to water.
Iron nails rusts.
Feelings change.
Because everything... changes. And for a long time...  thought I had to change with it.

I grew up in a house where people would yell, then laugh an hour or two later—like nothing happened.  
If someone got mad, we gave them space and silence… and they'd be fine.  
So I thought that’s how emotions worked: you just wait for them to pass.  
You crash, then reboot.

But it wasn’t that simple for me.

I would get calls from my mother where she would proceed to ask me questions and feel incredibly angry when I answer.

I didn’t understand how she moved on so fast.  
And I’d feel guilty—because once I calmed down, I’d realize maybe she had a reason to be upset.  
Maybe I was the one being unreasonable.

So I started believing that my emotions were wrong.  
That what I felt didn’t matter… or worse, wasn’t real.  
So I tried to stop feeling altogether.  
To become someone the world wouldn’t argue with.  
Someone who _fit._

But the truth is… you don’t stop feeling.  
You just run from it.  
And someone made me realize that.
They didn’t fix me. They just listened.  
And in that silence, I heard myself again.

I realized:  
The world can change, twist, break itself and rebuild a thousand times.  
But I don’t have to lose myself just to keep up.  
My emotions aren’t the enemy.  
They’re proof I’m still here. Still me.
