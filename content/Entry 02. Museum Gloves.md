I was the coward—for daring not to know, for being afraid to let go, for letting you blame yourself, when none of this would've happened if not for me. 

  

I imagined every worst version of how you’d see me if I were myself—too loud, too rough, too much—and in doing so, I held back everything real. I became so afraid of losing you that I hid myself in the dark first, just so you wouldn’t be disappointed with the person I really am.

  

I was the fool for thinking the way I love you is not enough. I kept imitating what I thought you wanted from me, instead of being real with you. I was scared you'd break from the roughness in me—how I yell when I'm excited, how I never learned to whisper, how I don't know how to be soft. And somehow it was the fear that broke you instead.

  

I wanted you to stay okay. I really did. I was just scared, and I wasn’t brave enough to tell you. And like you said, I really am a big dumbass for shrinking myself, and making fabricate an “ideal” version of me. I knew I was wrong for pretending. I just thought that if I looked smart, cool, and perfect enough, maybe you’d stay.

  

Like Dickens wrote: “In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.” I knew I should’ve just been honest. But I wasn’t. I tried to protect us by being someone else. I realized it too late that 

  

And so, I became the wreck, whose cowardice only hurt the same people I only wanted to protect. I can’t turn back time and reverse what happened. So this time, I'll make sure to hurt you less by just being myself. I won’t pretend to be a goody two shoes again. I’ll be the person I am, loud edges and all. That’s what I should’ve done in the first place.
