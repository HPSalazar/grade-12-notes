# Classical Breeding
- Focuses on mating of organisms with desirable qualities.

---

# Genetic Engineering
- **Use of molecular techniques to modify traits of target organisms**:
  - Introduction of new traits.
  - Enhancement of a present trait by increasing gene expression.
  - Enhancement of a present trait by disrupting gene suppression.
---
# Genetic Manipulation
- Process of *inducing changes in gene expression or introducing expression of novel genes.*
---
# Steps in Genetic Engineering

## 1. Gene Cloning
- Inserting a DNA fragment into a cloning vector to **make many copies.**

> [!example] Types  
> 1. Nuclear Cloning / Transfer  
> 2. Transgenic Organisms

### Nuclear Cloning / Transfer
- **Nucleus** from a donor cell *is inserted into an enucleated host cell.*

### Transgenic Organisms
- An organism that **contains and expresses a gene from another species**, such as Bt corn or AquaAdvantage salmon.

# Transgenic Plants

> [!example]+ Types  
> 1. Roundup Ready Corn/Soybeans  
> 2. Bt Corn  
> 3. Bt Cotton  
> 4. Golden Rice  
> 5. Banana Vaccine  
> 6. Venomous Cabbage  
> 7. Flavr Savr Tomato

## Roundup Ready Corn/Soybeans
- Genetically modified to resist Roundup (a herbicide).

## Bt Corn
- Carries *Bacillus thuringiensis* gene that **produces insecticidal protein toxic to corn borers** but safe for mammals.

## Bt Cotton
- Contains the same *Bt* gene, **protecting crops from cotton bollworms.**

## Golden Rice
- **Enriched with beta-carotene** to help prevent Vitamin A deficiency.

## Banana Vaccine
- **Engineered to carry Hepatitis B or cholera antigens**â€”triggers immune response when eaten.

## Venomous Cabbage
- **Produces protein from scorpion venom to kill caterpillars** but is safe for human consumption.

## Flavr Savr Tomato
- *First FDA-approved GMO food* with an **antisense gene to slow ripening and preserve natural flavor.**
