# Classical Breeding
- Focuses on mating of organisms with desirable qualities.

---

# Genetic Engineering
- **Use of molecular techniques to modify traits of target organisms**:
  - Introduction of new traits.
  - Enhancement of a present trait by increasing gene expression.
  - Enhancement of a present trait by disrupting gene suppression.
---
# Genetic Manipulation
- Process of *inducing changes in gene expression or introducing expression of novel genes.*
---
# Steps in Genetic Engineering

## 1. Gene Cloning
- Inserting a DNA fragment into a cloning vector to **make many copies.**

> [!example] Types  
> 1. Nuclear Cloning / Transfer  
> 2. Transgenic Organisms

### Nuclear Cloning / Transfer
- **Nucleus** from a donor cell *is inserted into an enucleated host cell.*

### Transgenic Organisms
- An organism that **contains and expresses a gene from another species**, such as Bt corn or AquaAdvantage salmon.

# Transgenic Plants

> [!example]+ Types  
> 1. Roundup Ready Corn/Soybeans  
> 2. Bt Corn  
> 3. Bt Cotton  
> 4. Golden Rice  
> 5. Banana Vaccine  
> 6. Venomous Cabbage  
> 7. Flavr Savr Tomato

## Roundup Ready Corn/Soybeans
- Genetically modified to resist Roundup (a herbicide).

## Bt Corn
- Carries *Bacillus thuringiensis* gene that **produces insecticidal protein toxic to corn borers** but safe for mammals.

## Bt Cotton
- Contains the same *Bt* gene, **protecting crops from cotton bollworms.**

## Golden Rice
- **Enriched with beta-carotene** to help prevent Vitamin A deficiency.

## Banana Vaccine
- **Engineered to carry Hepatitis B or cholera antigens**—triggers immune response when eaten.

## Venomous Cabbage
- **Produces protein from scorpion venom to kill caterpillars** but is safe for human consumption.

## Flavr Savr Tomato
- *First FDA-approved GMO food* with an **antisense gene to slow ripening and preserve natural flavor.**

# Transgenic Animals

> [!example]+ Types  
> 1. Protein Milk Goats  
> 2. Bovine Growth Hormone Cows  
> 3. Low-Methane Cows  
> 4. Oncomouse  
> 5. Knockout Mice  
> 6. Fluorescent Animals  
> 7. Transgenic Pigs  
> 8. AquaAdvantage Salmon

## Protein Milk Goats 
- **Produce antithrombin protein (ATryn)** to treat hereditary AT deficiency.  
- Another are *"spider goats"* that produce spider silk proteins in milk.

## Bovine Growth Hormone Cows
- Injected with synthetic hormone to **boost milk production by 10–20%.**

## Low-Methane Cows
- **Engineered to produce ~25% less methane,** reducing environmental impact.

## Oncomouse
- **Genetically altered to develop cancer;** used in tumor research.

## Knockout Mice
- **Genes** like leptin *are disabled to study their function*.

## Fluorescent Animals
- Express jellyfish (GFP) genes and **glow under UV light**; used in tracking gene expression.

## Transgenic Pigs 
- Cleaner manure with less phosphorus (reduces water pollution).  
- Omega-3 enriched for heart health.  
- Cow gene implant boosts milk production.

## AquaAdvantage Salmon
- Grows to market size in half the normal time of Atlantic salmon.

# Recombinant DNA Technology
- General **process of joining DNA from different species and inserting it into a host organism** (usually bacteria, fungi, or viruses).

> [!example] Steps  
> 1. Isolation of Genetic Material  
> 2. Restriction Enzyme Digestion  
> 3. Amplification using PCR  
> 4. Ligation  
> 5. Transformation  
> 6. Selection  
> 7. Culturing

## Isolation of Genetic Material
- **DNA is extracted and purified** using *restriction enzymes.*

## Restriction Enzyme Digestion
- **DNA is cut into fragments** and run on *agarose gel electrophoresis* to reveal the progress of restriction enzyme digestion.

## Amplification using PCR
- **DNA polymerase** is *used to make multiple copies of target DNA* in vitro.

## Ligation
- Vector and target DNA are cut with the same enzyme, then **"glued" together using DNA ligase.**

## Transformation
- **Recombinant DNA is inserted into host cells** (commonly *E. coli*).

## Isolate Recombinant Cells
- **Transformed cells are isolated from untransformed ones**, often using antibiotic resistance.

## Culturing
- The **host cells multiply** and express the foreign gene.
