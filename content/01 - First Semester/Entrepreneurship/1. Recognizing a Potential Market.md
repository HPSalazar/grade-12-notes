## Five Forces of Competition (Michael Porter) - Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Bargaining Power of Buyers
**Definition**: The influence customers have on pricing and terms.

**Key Factors**:
- **Multiple suppliers available**: When buyers have many alternative suppliers, their bargaining power increases.
- **Potential for backward integration**: If buyers can produce the product themselves, they gain leverage.
- **Low switching costs**: Easy transition between suppliers strengthens buyer position.
- **High percentage of buyer's costs**: When the product represents a significant portion of buyer expenses, they negotiate harder.
- **Large purchase volumes**: Bulk buyers can demand better terms and discounts.

> [!NOTE]
> Buyer power is strongest in commoditized markets with many alternatives.

### 2. Threat of New Entrants
**Definition**: The risk of new competitors entering the market.

**Barriers to Entry**:
- **Substantial capital requirements**: High startup costs deter new competitors.
- **Government regulations**: Licensing requirements and restrictions limit new entrants.
- **Distribution channel access**: Established relationships make it hard for newcomers to reach customers.
- **Economies of scale**: Existing players' cost advantages create barriers.
- **Product differentiation**: Strong brand loyalty makes it hard to compete.
- **High switching costs**: Customers reluctant to change to new providers.

> [!WARNING]
> Industries with low barriers to entry face constant competitive pressure.

### 3. Competitive Rivalry
**Definition**: Intensity of competition among existing firms.

**Determining Factors**:
- **Diversity of competitors**: Different strategies increase competitive pressure.
- **Number of competitors**: More players means fiercer competition.
- **Product characteristics**: Commodity products lead to price wars.
- **Excess capacity**: Unused production capacity encourages aggressive pricing.
- **High fixed costs**: Pressure to cover costs increases competition.
- **Slow market growth**: Companies fight harder for market share.

> [!TIP]
> Rivalry is most intense in mature, slow-growth industries.

### 4. Threat of Substitute Products
**Definition**: Alternative products that fulfill the same need.

**Risk Factors**:
- **Low switching costs**: Easy for customers to choose alternatives.
- **Changing customer preferences**: Trends can quickly shift demand.
- **High product differentiation**: Many alternatives available.
- **Improving substitute quality**: Better alternatives emerge.
- **Lower substitute prices**: Cost advantage attracts customers.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Streaming services substituting for cable TV demonstrates this threat.

### 5. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
**Definition**: Suppliers' ability to influence prices and terms.

**Power Indicators**:
- **Forward integration potential**: Suppliers can bypass you to sell directly to customers.
- **Few dominant suppliers**: Limited alternatives increase supplier leverage.
- **Scarce substitutes**: Unique materials give suppliers more control.
- **High switching costs**: Difficult or expensive to change suppliers.
- **Unique products/services**: Specialized inputs reduce buyer options.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Supplier power is strongest in industries requiring specialized components.
