## 1. Concepts of Products and Services  

> [!INFO] **Product Definition**  
> Anything (tangible/intangible) **that satisfies customer needs/wants** and *has monetary value.*  

### Three Levels of Product  

#### 1.1 Core Product  
> [!NOTE] **Intangible Benefit**  
> - The fundamental value proposition.  
> - *Example*: A car's core product = **convenience of transportation**.  

#### 1.2 Actual Product  
> [!NOTE] **Tangible Item**  
> - Physical attributes and features.  
> - *Example*: The car itself (design, engine, color).  

#### 1.3 Augmented Product  
> [!NOTE] **Non-Physical Enhancements**  
> - Additional services/perks.  
> - *Example*: Warranty, free maintenance, customer support.

## 2. Service Products  
> [!definition] What is a Service Product?  
> It is an **intangible output** created by the work of individuals or systems. It does not result in ownership of anything.

> [!INFO]+ **Key Attributes of Services**:  
> 1. **Intangibility**: Cannot be touched/stored (e.g., consulting).  
> 2. **Variability**: Quality depends on provider/context (e.g., haircuts).  
> 3. **Inseparability**: Produced/consumed simultaneously (e.g., live music).  
> 4. **Perishability**: Unused capacity is lost (e.g., hotel rooms).  

> [!TIP] **Service vs. Product**  
> Services lack physical form but create value through experiences (e.g., education, healthcare).
