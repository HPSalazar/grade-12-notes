This has been one of my top 10 songs since I first heard it. I relate to it so hard that I play it every time I want to get out of my head. 

When I am stuggling with something---most likely my emotions---I do everything that I can just to escape it. I run away from the things that hurt me. Because after I run, I usually feel better. But in truth, I'm not really healing----I'm just numbing myself, burying the feelings deep down until I eventually burst.

Unwrapping and processing about what I feel has always felt too daunting. It would hunt me in my sleep for days, then I would progressively get more guilty for feeling that way at all. When I hide from my emotions, the loud conversations inside my head would fade and stay in the background. I can then focus on functioning, on surviving.


But sometimes I wonder---can I really call it freedom if I have to disappear to feel it? If I have to silence and kill parts of myself just to make it through the day?

I still act like my feelings are criminals that keep on chasing me with a knife in broad daylight, but I can muster up the courage to call the police. To stop running. To face them.
