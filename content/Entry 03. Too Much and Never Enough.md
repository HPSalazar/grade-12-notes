Loving others is supposed to be a source of warmth and not performance. But sometimes, love begins to feel like vaulting over a bar that keeps getting higher or walking through a door that only gets smaller. No matter how much you give, you find yourself trying to prove that you're enough. And still, it never seems enough.

  

You give more, more, and more until you run out—then suddenly you're too much. You won't be enough when you hold back, and too much when you open up. You just get to the point where you lock yourself with self-doubt and wonder where exactly the line is between being lovable or overwhelming.

  

At its worst, love would begin to feel like a race where you'll need to keep sprinting forward to expectations you didn’t even set. They'll say "I love you", and then criticize you based on their own standards without seeing who you really are. You'd think that you're always less and should always be less.  You start thinking you should shrink—be less, want less, speak less, feel less—just to be accepted. They would always keep asking for more—and when you finally give it your all—they turn around, and say it’s too much. You’re either not enough or you’re too much to handle. It's a no-win game.

  

I hate to say it, but I've been there. I'm still there. And I still wake up in that prison every day. It’s hard to unlearn how to stop shrinking, questioning every word, every gesture, just to avoid being told you’re overwhelming.

  

Loving others should never cost you your own peace. And if it does, then it's time to consider whether that kind of love is worth abandoning yourself for.
